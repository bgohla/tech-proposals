# Haskell Foundation Tech Proposals

[![Hackage](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=Haskell%20Foundation&message=official&color=purple&style=for-the-badge)](https://haskell.foundation)

This repository is for the [Haskell Foundation](https://haskell.foundation) tech proposals. Haskell Foundation tech proposals are similar to [GHC proposals](https://github.com/ghc-proposals/ghc-proposals) in that they are the venue by which items are added to the HF technical agenda, pending final review from its Board of Directors. This repository is maintained by the Haskell Foundation and its volunteers. If you would like to get started with a merge request, please consult the documentation below.
